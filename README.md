# What is this

A python script automatically auth via portal in WHUT.

It will function when you boot and automatically connect to the correct WI-FI, such as WHUT-WLAN, WHUT-WLAN6, etc.

# How to use
You can run it by directly using python command like 

<code>python ./autologinwlan.py</code>.

# Use it by running exe
Pyinstaller is an another optional consideration.

<code>pyinstaller ./autologinwlan.py -F -w</code>.

If it doesn't works properly, plz install pyinstaller by

<code>pip install pyinstaller </code>.

By generating an execution file, you can put it in "startup" folder by pressing WIN+R, entering "shell:startup" and dragging it into the folder.

Enjoy it :).
